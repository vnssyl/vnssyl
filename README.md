## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vanessa!

I'm a biostatistics grad student interested in machine learning, health data science, and applied statistics.  
I love turning messy real-world datasets into meaningful insights. 

### ðŸ•º Greatest Hits

#### ðŸ§ª Simulation Study: Time-Dependent Covariates
Designed and ran a simulation study comparing survival models (Cox, RSF, GBST) under varying conditions using time-dependent covariates.  
*Tools:* R, Python, survival analysis, ML

#### ðŸ“ˆ Drug Expenditure Forecasting
Time-series models (ARIMA, GBM) to forecast provincial Metformin costs, working with 990M+ claims records.  
*Tools:* Python, PySpark

#### ðŸ“Š logiSense R Package
Built an R package to interpret logistic regression models, including interaction terms and multivariate outputs.  
*Tools:* R, tidyverse

Thanks for stopping by!
